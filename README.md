## Playing music in Python3

Yo, we all like 🎵! And Python. So I made some Python all about Music. 🎵🎵🎵 😉

To install all the requirements for this project, run:
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
And to run the main file:
```
$ python3 play.py
```

## Android
Don't worry about this directory unless you are trying to use this app in Termux on an android phone(like I do). The differences are that in the android version, I do *not* use VLC, because of compatibility issues and such. I use the [`play-audio` package](https://github.com/termux/play-audio) which can be installed by running:
```
pkg install play-audio
```
