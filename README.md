## Playing music in Python3

Yo, we all like ðŸŽµ! And Python. So I made some Python all about Music. ðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµ ðŸ˜‰

To install all the requirements for this project, run:
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Also, for the VLC version, VLC Media Player is required to be installed on your computer. You can download it for MacOS, Linux or Windows(I guess) from [videolan](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html).  
To run the main file:
```
$ cd vlc/
$ python3 play.py
```

## Android
### Discontinued: Buy an iPhone
Don't worry about this directory unless you are trying to use this app in Termux on an android phone(like I used too). The differences are that in the android version, I do *not* use VLC, because of compatibility issues and such. I use the [`play-audio` package](https://github.com/termux/play-audio) which can be installed by running:
```
pkg install play-audio
```

## MyFreeMp3
Alternative method of downloading songs via selenium. It's faster than youtube-dl. Read about it [here](https://github.com/noahbroyles/Music/blob/master/myFreeMp3/README.md).
