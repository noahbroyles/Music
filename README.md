## Playing music in Python3

Yo, we all like ðŸŽµ! And Python. So I made some Python all about Music. ðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµ ðŸ˜‰

To install all the requirements for this project, run:
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Also, for the VLC version, VLC Media Player is required to be installed on your computer. You can download it for MacOS, Linux or Windows(I guess) from [videolan](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html).  
To run the main file:
```
$ cd vlc/
$ python3 play.py
```

## MyFreeMp3
Alternative method of downloading songs via selenium. It's faster than youtube-dl. Read about it [here](https://github.com/noahbroyles/Music/blob/master/myFreeMp3/README.md).
